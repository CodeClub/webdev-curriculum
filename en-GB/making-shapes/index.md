## Activity Checklist { .check }

+ The steps should be broken down into a number of checkpoints. You can add text in __bold__ or _italics_ to add emphasis to key words or important points.

+ Each checkpoint should clearly explain what the child needs to do.

+ To aid clarity, you can also include images, like this:

	![screenshot](images/image.png)

+ You should also regularly remind children to save their project:

## Save your project { .save }

## Test your project { .flag }
You should regularly ask children to test their project, so that they can see the effects of the code they're creating. You can even use these points as opportunities to fix bugs and improve code.

## Challenge: Challenge name {.challenge}
You should add at least 1 challenge, to allow children to apply what they've during the project. You can ask children to fix a problem or improve or adapt their project in some way.
